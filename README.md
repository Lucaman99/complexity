# complexity

A small, lightweight library for studying complexity geometry of quantum systems.

The goal of this library is to characterize gate and state complexity geometry, as was originally outlined by Michael Nielsen. Functionality in this library includes defining metrics and Christoffel symbols, defining unitary parametrizations, solving geodesic equations, and computing complexities.
